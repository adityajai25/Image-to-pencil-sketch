# Image to Pencil Sketch using python

ğŸ‘‰ The mission here is to convert the Image into pencil sketch.

ğŸ‘‰ First, convert the RGB image into grayscale.

ğŸ‘‰ Then convert the grayscale into negative imaging which is inverting the grayscale image.

ğŸ‘‰ This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image.

ğŸ‘‰ These things can be done using cv2 library.
